🌐 Internet Access in Private Subnet using AWS NAT Gateway
Welcome to my latest project on configuring internet access in a private subnet using AWS NAT Gateway.

🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I demonstrate how to design and implement a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with private and public subnets, launch EC2 instances, and configure a NAT Gateway for internet access. This hands-on project showcases key AWS networking services and best practices for cloud infrastructure.

📂 Project Structure

VPC Setup: Designed and deployed a Virtual Private Cloud to segment network, ensuring robust security and flexibility.
EC2 Instances: Launched Two EC2 instances within the private and public subnet, enhancing infrastructure's computing capabilities.
NAT Gateway Configuration: Implemented a NAT Gateway to enable outbound internet traffic from the private subnet while maintaining inbound traffic restrictions.
Route Tables: Configured route tables to direct traffic from the private subnet through the NAT Gateway, ensuring seamless and secure internet access.
Security Groups & NACLs: Fine-tuned security groups and network ACLs to enhance security and control access at multiple layers.

📈 Key Features

VPC Design: Creation of a VPC with public and private subnets for enhanced security.
EC2 Deployment: Launching EC2 instances in the private subnet.
NAT Gateway Configuration: Enabling outbound internet access for instances in the private subnet.
Route Table Setup: Configuring route tables to direct traffic through the NAT Gateway.
Security Enhancements: Implementing security groups and network ACLs for robust access control.

🔍 Key Learnings

AWS VPC: Understanding network segmentation and security.
EC2 Management: Efficient deployment and management of compute resources.
NAT Gateway: Setting up and configuring NAT Gateway for secure internet access.
Networking Principles: Applying best practices in route table configuration and security.
